* First Exercise: Describing an adder in RTL and HLS

This exercise aims to introduce the student to the RTL and HLS workflow. The RTL is the legacy workflow whereas the HLS is a novel workflow that claims to be more than 10x faster than the conventional RTL workflow.

This exercise is composed of to steps:

* [RTL Guide](first-exercise/adder/RTL/GUIDE.md)
* [HLS Guide](first-exercise/adder/HLS/GUIDE.md)

Both implement a 12-bit fixed-point adder with simple code. There are differences in the workflow and the idea is to prepare the environment.
